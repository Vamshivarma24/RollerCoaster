# RollerCoaster
This repository contains code for analyzing roller coaster data using Python's pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. The analysis involves cleaning the data, exploring various features, and visualizing relationships between different variables.

# Requirements
  Python 3.x
  pandas
  matplotlib
  seaborn

# Installation
1) Clone this repository to your local machine:
  git clone (https://github.com/Vamshivarma24/RollerCoaster)
2) Install the required dependencies using pip:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Ensure you have the necessary data file (coaster_db.csv) in the project directory.
Run the Python script rollercoaster.py.

python rollercoaster.py
The script will generate visualizations and statistical insights based on the roller coaster data.

# Files
coaster_db.csv: Raw data file containing information about roller coasters.
roller_coaster_analysis.py: Python script for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

# Features
Data Cleaning:
  1) Dropping unnecessary columns.
  2) Handling missing values.
  3) Renaming columns for clarity.

Feature Understanding:
  1) Visualizing the top 10 years roller coasters were introduced.
  2) Analyzing roller coaster speed distribution.
  3) Investigating the relationship between speed and height.

Pairplot Visualization:
  1) Creating pairplots to explore relationships between multiple variables.

Correlation Analysis:
  1) Calculating correlation between years introduced, speed, height, inversions, and G-force.
  2) Visualizing correlation using a heatmap.
